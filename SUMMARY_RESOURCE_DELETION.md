# ✅ Summary: Individual Resource Deletion Feature

## What Was Added

I've implemented individual delete functionality for cookies and IP proxies in the admin resources page. Now admins can delete resources one by one, giving you precise control over your resource management.

### 3. Existing Bulk Delete

- **Success toast** - "Successfully deleted..."
- **Error toast** - Clear error messages if something fails

---

## 🔒 Security

### Admin-Only Access:
- RLS policies enforce admin role
- Server actions validate permissions
- Client components are just UI triggers

### Safe Deletion:
- Confirmation required for every deletion
- Cannot be undone (intentional)
- Database constraints respected
