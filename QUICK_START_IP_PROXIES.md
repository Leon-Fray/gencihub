# IP Proxy System - Quick Start ðŸš€

## What's Implemented

âœ… **IP Proxy Assignment System**
- VAs can request IP proxies from the New Account page
- Each IP is assigned only once (no duplicates)
- IPs automatically copied to clipboard
- IPs loaded from `proxyList300.txt` file

âœ… **Integrated Sync Button**
- The existing "Sync from Storage" button now syncs BOTH cookies AND IPs
- One button for all resource syncing
- Shows combined results

âœ… **Admin Dashboard**
- View all IP proxies with assignment status
- Track which VAs have which IPs
- See line numbers from the file

## Quick Setup (4 Steps)

### 1. Run Database Migration

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/add_ip_proxies_table.sql
```

This creates the `ip_proxies` table and adds `ip_proxy_id` to `resource_assignments`.

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ **Storage**
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Name: `ips`
4. Set to **Private**
5. Click **"Create bucket"**

### 3. Set Storage Policies

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- File: supabase/storage_policies_ips.sql
```

This allows admins to read/write files in the `ips` bucket.

### 4. Upload IP Proxy File

1. Create `proxyList300.txt` with one IP per line:
   ```
   123.45.67.89:8080
   98.76.54.32:3128
   192.168.1.100:8888
   ```

2. Upload to the `ips` bucket (root level, no folders)

### 5. Sync from Storage

1. Go to `/admin/resources`
2. Click **"Sync from Storage"** button
3. The button will sync both cookies AND IPs
4. Success message will show how many of each were added

## How to Use

### For VAs

1. Go to `/dashboard/new-account`
2. Scroll to "Request Resources" section
3. Click **"Request IP"** button
4. IP is assigned and auto-copied to clipboard âœ“
5. Paste anywhere to use the IP

### For Admins

**View IP Proxies:**
- Go to `/admin/resources`
- See "IP Proxies" card showing all IPs
- Green = Available, Blue = Assigned

**Sync More IPs:**
- Add more lines to `proxyList300.txt`
- Re-upload the file
- Click "Sync from Storage"
- Only new IPs will be added

**Track Assignments:**
- See "Resource Assignment History" section
- Shows which VA got which IP
- Includes timestamp and assignment type

## File Locations

### Created Files
- âœ… `components/request-ip-button.tsx` - VA request button
- âœ… `supabase/migrations/add_ip_proxies_table.sql` - Database migration
- âœ… `supabase/storage_policies_ips.sql` - Storage policies
- âœ… Documentation files (this and others)

### Modified Files
- âœ… `lib/actions.ts` - Added IP proxy functions
- âœ… `components/sync-cookies-button.tsx` - Now syncs IPs too
- âœ… `app/admin/resources/page.tsx` - Added IP proxies display
- âœ… `components/new-account-page-client.tsx` - Added IP request button

## Key Features

ðŸ”¹ **One-Time Assignment** - Each IP assigned to only one VA  
ðŸ”¹ **Auto-Copy** - IP automatically copied to clipboard  
ðŸ”¹ **File-Based** - Load from `proxyList300.txt`  
ðŸ”¹ **Sequential** - IPs assigned in order from file  
ðŸ”¹ **Line Tracking** - Know which line each IP came from  
ðŸ”¹ **Integrated** - Works seamlessly with existing cookie system  

## The Sync Button Now Does Both!

When you click **"Sync from Storage"**, it will:
1. âœ… Sync cookie files from `cookies` bucket
2. âœ… Sync IP proxies from `ips` bucket
3. âœ… Show combined results: "Added 5 cookies and 10 IPs from storage."

**No need for separate buttons!** Everything is handled by one sync button.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration ran successfully
- [ ] `ips` bucket created
- [ ] Storage policies set
- [ ] `proxyList300.txt` uploaded
- [ ] "Sync from Storage" synced IPs
- [ ] IP proxies visible in admin dashboard
- [ ] VA can request IP successfully
- [ ] IP auto-copied to clipboard
- [ ] Assignment shows in admin view

## Troubleshooting

**"File not found" error:**
- Check bucket name is exactly `ips`
- Check file name is exactly `proxyList300.txt`
- Ensure file is in root of bucket (no subfolders)

**"All IPs assigned" error:**
- All IPs have been used
- Add more IPs to the file
- Re-upload and sync again

**Sync button doesn't show IPs:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify migration ran
- Refresh the page

## What's Next?

You're all set! The IP proxy system is ready to use:

1. âœ… Database configured
2. âœ… Storage bucket ready
3. âœ… File uploaded
4. âœ… IPs synced
5. âœ… VAs can request IPs
6. âœ… Admin can track assignments

Just run the migration, create the bucket, upload the file, and click sync! ðŸŽ‰
